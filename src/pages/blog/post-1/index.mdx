<h2 id="dark-mode">Dark mode</h2>

Ever since iOS added native dark mode all you dark mode nerds haven't been able to leave me alone about adding it to Tailwind. Well you did it, it's here, you win.

Open up your `tailwind.config.js` file and flip `darkMode` to `media`:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  darkMode: 'media',
  // ...
}
```

Boom â€” now just add `dark:` to the beginning of a class like `bg-black` and it'll only take effect when dark mode is enabled:

```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-black">
  <h1 class="text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Dark mode</h1>
  <p class="text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-300">
    The feature you've all been waiting for.
  </p>
</div>
```

Works with hover and stuff too:

```html
<button
  class="bg-gray-900 hover:bg-gray-800 dark:bg-white dark:hover:bg-gray-50"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</button>
```

And responsive stuff:

```html
<div class="... lg:bg-white lg:dark:bg-black">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

And responsive hover stuff:

```html
<button class="... lg:dark:bg-white lg:dark:hover:bg-gray-50">
  <!-- ... -->
</button>
```

Check out the [dark mode docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode) for all the gory details.

<h2 id="extra-wide-2-xl-breakpoint">Extra wide 2XL breakpoint</h2>

I'm pretty sure they make an iPhone that is 1280px wide now, so it's time to step it up.

We've added a new `2xl` breakpoint out-of-the-box that lets you target things at 1536px and above:

```html
<h1 class="... 2xl:text-9xl">Godzilla</h1>
```

Exciting I know but also let's be serious [you've been able to add this yourself](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#customizing-breakpoints) for like three years. Now it's blessed though, I get it.

<h2 id="new-outline-ring-utilities">New outline ring utilities</h2>

You know how the `outline` property ignores border radius and pretty much just always looks bad? The `ring` utilities are our attempt to will a better solution into existence through blood, sweat, and tears.

They work a lot like the `border` utilities, except they add a solid box-shadow rather than a border so they don't impact the layout:

```html
<button
  class="... focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-300 focus:ring-opacity-50"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</button>
```

You can even offset them to create a sort of halo effect with `ring-offset-{width}` utilities:

```html
<button
  class="... focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-300 focus:ring-opacity-50"
>
  <!-- ... -->
</button>
```

Using a bunch of CSS custom property voodoo we've even made them automatically combine with regular box-shadows, too:

```html
<button class="shadow-sm focus:ring-2 ...">
  <!-- Both the shadow and ring will render together -->
</button>
```

The [ring width documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/ring-width) is the best starting point for learning these new APIs. They seriously turned out so cool, more useful than you probably think.

<h2 id="utility-friendly-form-styles">Utility-friendly form styles</h2>

One thing I am constantly surprised by is how few people complain about how unbelievably useless form elements are out of the box with Tailwind. They literally look awful and you can't do anything about it without writing custom CSS full of weird background-image SVG tricks and worrying about obscure edge cases that require CSS properties you've never heard of before like `color-adjust`.

I tried to solve this a while back with the [@tailwindcss/custom-forms](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-custom-forms) plugin, but something about adding a bunch of classes like `form-input` and `form-checkbox` just didn't feel quite right so we didn't really promote it and didn't even link to it from the Tailwind documentation. This time though I think we figured it out.

Alongside Tailwind CSS v2.0, we're releasing a brand new official plugin called `@tailwindcss/forms` that normalizes and resets all of the basic form controls across browsers to a state that is super easy to style with pure utility classes:

```html
<!-- This will be a nice rounded checkbox with an indigo focus ring and an indigo checked state -->
<input
  type="checkbox"
  class="h-4 w-4 rounded border-gray-300 focus:border-indigo-300 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-200 focus:ring-opacity-50 text-indigo-500"
/>
```

It's not included out of the box but you can add it to your `tailwind.config.js` file with a single line:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/forms')],
}
```

Check out [the @tailwindcss/forms documentation](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-forms) for more information.

<h2 id="default-line-heights-per-font-size">
  Default line-heights per font-size
</h2>

Every font-size utility in Tailwind now comes paired with a sensible default line-height:

```js
// Tailwind's default theme
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    // ...
    fontSize: {
      xs: ['0.75rem', { lineHeight: '1rem' }],
      sm: ['0.875rem', { lineHeight: '1.25rem' }],
      base: ['1rem', { lineHeight: '1.5rem' }],
      lg: ['1.125rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],
      xl: ['1.25rem', { lineHeight: '1.75rem' }],
      '2xl': ['1.5rem', { lineHeight: '2rem' }],
      '3xl': ['1.875rem', { lineHeight: '2.25rem' }],
      '4xl': ['2.25rem', { lineHeight: '2.5rem' }],
      '5xl': ['3rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],
      '6xl': ['3.75rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],
      '7xl': ['4.5rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],
      '8xl': ['6rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],
      '9xl': ['8rem', { lineHeight: '1' }],
    },
  },
}
```

So now when you add a utility like `text-xl`, the corresponding default line-height (`1.75rem` in this case) is added automatically:

```html
<p class="text-xl">This will have a line-height of 1.75rem automatically.</p>
```

If you want to override this, you can still do it by layering on a `leading` utility:

```html
<p class="text-3xl leading-normal">Come on don't do this to me.</p>
```

Check out the [font size documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/font-size#providing-a-default-line-height) for some additional details.

<h2 id="extended-spacing-typography-and-opacity-scales">
  Extended spacing, typography, and opacity scales
</h2>

We've extended the default spacing scale to include a bunch of micro values like `0.5`, `1.5`, `2.5`, and `3.5`:

```html
<span class="ml-0.5">Just a little nudge.</span>
```

...as well as a bunch of new values at the top end as well like `72`, `80`, and `96`:

```html
<div class="p-96">This is too much padding.</div>
```

We've also extended the `inset` (that's top/right/bottom/left for you dinosaurs) and `translate` plugins to include the full spacing scale, so now you can do things like this:

```html
<div class="top-8">
  <!-- .... -->
</div>
```

We've extended the default typography scale with new `7xl`, `8xl`, and `9xl` values:

```html
<h1 class="text-9xl font-bold">What is this, an Apple website?</h1>
```

And we've also extended the default opacity scale with steps of 10, as well as 5 and 95 values:

```html
<figure class="opacity-5">
  <blockquote>You can't see me.</blockquote>
  <figcaption>John Cena</figcaption>
</figure>
```

<h2 id="use-apply-with-anything">Use @apply with anything</h2>

By far the most common question I've gotten over the years is "why doesn't `@apply hover:bg-black` work?"

And it's a fair question, it's stupid that it ~~doesn't~~ didn't work.

It took some serious engineering muscle but we figured it out â€” now you can `@apply` literally anything:

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-indigo-500 hover:bg-indigo-600 focus:ring-2 focus:ring-indigo-200 focus:ring-opacity-50;
}
```

Check out [the updated @apply documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) to learn more.

<h2 id="new-text-overflow-utilities">New text overflow utilities</h2>

Up until v2.0, if you wanted to control overflowing text all we really gave you was the fairly heavy-handed `truncate` utility.

Now we've added dedicated `overflow-ellipsis` and `overflow-clip` utilities to control _just_ the `text-overflow` property, in case you wanted to add ellipsis to overflowing text without restricting that text to one line.

```html
<p class="overflow-ellipsis overflow-hidden">
  Look ma no whitespace-nowrap ipsum...
</p>
```

Check out the new [text overflow documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/text-overflow) to see it in action.

<h2 id="extend-variants">Extend variants</h2>

You know what sucks? Wanting to enable `focus-visible` for `backgroundColor` but having to list _every single default variant_ just to add one extra one:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  variants: {
    backgroundColor: ['responsive', 'hover', 'focus', 'focus-visible'],
  },
}
```

You know what's better? Just adding the one you want to enable:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  variants: {
    extend: {
      backgroundColor: ['focus-visible'],
    },
  },
}
```

<h2 id="group-hover-and-focus-within-by-default">
  Group-hover and focus-within by default
</h2>

One of the things we learned working on [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/components) is that `group-hover` and `focus-within` aren't nice-to-haves, they're must-haves.

Anywhere where we enabled hover or focus by default previously now has `group-hover` and `focus-within` enabled by default too:

```html
<div class="group ...">
  <span class="group-hover:text-blue-600 ...">Da ba dee da ba daa</span>
</div>
```

Check out [the default variants reference](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuring-variants#default-variants-reference) for a full list of what's enabled where in v2.0.

<h2 id="default-transition-duration-and-easing-curve">
  Default transition duration and easing curve
</h2>

Until now, any time you wanted to add a transition in Tailwind you typically needed to add three classes:

```html
<button class="... transition duration-150 ease-in-out">Count them</button>
```

In v2.0, we've made it possible to specify a default duration and timing function that is used automatically any time any `transitionProperty` utility is added:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  theme: {
    // ...
    transitionDuration: {
      DEFAULT: '150ms',
      // ...
    },
    transitionTimingFunction: {
      DEFAULT: 'cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)',
      // ...
    },
  },
}
```

So now you only need to write a single class if you have a common duration and timing function that you use really frequently:

```html
<button class="... transition">Count them again</button>
```

Of course you can override this by layering on separate duration or timing function utilities:

```html
<button class="... transition duration-300 ease-out">We're back baby</button>
```

Learn more about transitions in the [transition property documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/transition-property).

<h2 id="incompatibility-with-ie11">Incompatibility with IE11</h2>

We've decided to unburden ourselves with caring about IE11 at all, which has allowed us to fully embrace CSS custom properties for [all sorts of crazy stuff](https://adamwathan.me/composing-the-uncomposable-with-css-variables/) and is what makes things like the new `ring` utilities even possible.

Dropping IE11 support means smaller builds even when using PurgeCSS, because we don't have to ship any CSS variable fallbacks which adds up more than you'd expect.

Cheers to Bootstrap for having the cojones to [do this first](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/pull/30377) â€” I don't think we would have been so bold if they hadn't decided to pave the way.

The good news is that if you need to support IE11, you can always use Tailwind CSS v1.9 which is still an amazingly productive framework.

---

So there you have it folks, that's Tailwind CSS v2.0 in a _(pretty big)_ nutshell!
